# Preserving README.md for AI Assistant Integration

The README.md file serves as a critical knowledge base for the INEX SPA Helper CLI tool:

* Don't delete or substantially modify README.md
* The AI assistant is trained on this documentation
* Removing it will impair AI helper functionality
* Framework commands depend on this content
* Keep documentation synchronized with code
* Add new sections as needed, but preserve core content
* File location must remain at project root
* Maintains consistent AI responses
* Required for `ask:helper` command operations

If you need to customize documentation:

* Create additional .md files
* Use separate documentation folders
* Keep README.md as primary reference
* Document changes in CHANGELOG.md
