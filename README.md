## Cronjob Management

This application includes a cronjob management system to schedule and run background tasks. Tasks are defined as PHP classes and can be managed using the `ammar` CLI.

### Cron Runner

The core script for executing cron tasks is `core/cron/cron_runner.php`. This script is designed to be called by your system's cron daemon (e.g., crontab).

**Usage:**

```bash
/usr/bin/php /path/to/your/project/core/cron/cron_runner.php <TaskName> >> /path/to/your/project/core/logs/cron.log 2>&1
```

- Replace `/usr/bin/php` with the actual path to your PHP interpreter if different.
- Replace `/path/to/your/project/` with the absolute path to your application's root directory.
- `<TaskName>` is the name of the cron task class you want to run (e.g., `ExampleTask`).
- It's recommended to redirect output to the `core/logs/cron.log` file for monitoring.

### `ammar` CLI Commands for Cronjobs

The `ammar` CLI tool provides several commands to help manage your cron tasks:

**1. `list:cron`**

   Lists all available cron tasks. These are the `.php` files found in the `core/cron/tasks/` directory.

   **Usage:**
   ```bash
   php ammar list:cron
   ```

**2. `make:cron <TaskName>`**

   Creates a new cron task file in `core/cron/tasks/`. The `<TaskName>` should be a valid PHP class name (e.g., `MyDailyReport`).

   **Usage:**
   ```bash
   php ammar make:cron MyDailyReport
   ```
   This will generate `core/cron/tasks/MyDailyReport.php` with a template class structure. You'll need to edit this file to implement the task's logic within the `handle()` method.

**3. `run:cron <TaskName>`**

   Manually triggers a specific cron task. This is useful for testing your cron tasks without waiting for the scheduled time.

   **Usage:**
   ```bash
   php ammar run:cron <TaskName>
   ```
   Example:
   ```bash
   php ammar run:cron ExampleTask
   ```

**4. `delete:cron <TaskName>`**

   Deletes a specific cron task file from `core/cron/tasks/`. You will be prompted for confirmation.

   **Usage:**
   ```bash
   php ammar delete:cron <TaskName>
   ```

**5. `clear:cron`**

   Deletes ALL cron task files from `core/cron/tasks/`. This is a destructive operation and will require double confirmation.

   **Usage:**
   ```bash
   php ammar clear:cron
   ```

### Creating a New Cron Task

1.  Use the `make:cron` command to generate the task file:
    ```bash
    php ammar make:cron YourNewTaskName
    ```
2.  Open the generated file `core/cron/tasks/YourNewTaskName.php`.
3.  Implement your task's logic within the `handle()` method of the class. You can use any PHP code, access your application's models, services, or other functions as needed. Ensure necessary classes and functions are loaded, potentially by referencing how `core/cron/cron_runner.php` or `index.php` load dependencies. The `cron_runner.php` should provide a basic environment, but complex tasks might need to ensure their specific dependencies are met.
4.  Test your task using `php ammar run:cron YourNewTaskName`.
5.  Once ready, schedule it via your system's crontab by pointing to `core/cron/cron_runner.php YourNewTaskName`.

## Built-in Motion Engine

**Note:** This feature is currently in Beta. While functional, it may undergo changes, and we appreciate any feedback!

This framework includes a lightweight, dependency-free JavaScript motion engine to apply CSS animations to HTML elements.

### Enabling the Engine

The Motion Engine is controlled via an environment variable in your `.env` file:

- `USE_ANIMATE`: Set to `true` to enable the engine (default) or `false` to disable it.
  When enabled, the necessary JavaScript (`public/JS/motion_engine.js`) and CSS (`public/css/motion-animations.css`) files are automatically included in your pages.

Example `.env` entry:
```
USE_ANIMATE=true
```

### Using the `animate` function

The core of the engine is the `animate()` JavaScript function.

**Syntax:**
`animate(elementOrSelector, animationName, durationMs)`

- `elementOrSelector`: Can be either an HTMLElement object or a CSS selector string (e.g., `'#myElement'`, `'.my-class'`).
- `animationName`: A string representing the name of the animation to apply (e.g., `'fade-in'`). This corresponds to a CSS class `motion-{animationName}` defined in `public/css/motion-animations.css`.
- `durationMs`: An integer specifying the animation duration in milliseconds (e.g., `300`).

**Example Usage:**

```html
<div id="myBox">Hello!</div>

<script>
  // Get the element
  const box = document.getElementById('myBox');

  // Animate it with 'fade-in' over 300ms
  animate(box, 'fade-in', 300);

  // Or using a selector
  // animate('#myBox', 'fade-in', 300);
</script>
```
The function handles adding and removing the necessary CSS classes and setting the animation duration.

### Adding New Animations

To add new animations:

1.  **Define Keyframes**: Open `public/css/motion-animations.css` and define your `@keyframes`. It's recommended to prefix them with `motion-` for clarity.
    ```css
    @keyframes motion-slide-up {
      from {
        transform: translateY(20px);
        opacity: 0;
      }
      to {
        transform: translateY(0);
        opacity: 1;
      }
    }
    ```

2.  **Create Animation Class**: Add a corresponding CSS class that applies these keyframes.
    ```css
    .motion-slide-up {
      animation-name: motion-slide-up;
    }
    ```
    The base class `.motion-animate` (which includes `animation-fill-mode: forwards;`) will be automatically applied by the `animate` function.

3.  **Use in JavaScript**: You can now use `'slide-up'` as the `animationName` in the `animate` function:
    ```javascript
    animate('#anotherElement', 'slide-up', 500);
    ```

## ✨ INEX DevTools

The INEX SPA framework includes a built-in debug bar for development environments, providing valuable insights into your application's performance and structure.

### Features

-   **Debug Bar:** A persistent bar at the bottom of the screen in development mode.
-   **Performance Stats:** View execution time and memory usage for each request.
-   **Database Queries:** Inspect all SQL queries executed for a page.
-   **Route Information:** See details about the current route being displayed.
-   **Component Tree:** View a list of all PHP files included in the current request.

### Enabling DevTools

The DevTools are controlled by an environment variable in your `.env` file:

-   `DEV_MODE`: Set to `true` to enable the debug bar. Set to `false` or remove the line for production environments.

Example `.env` entry:

```
DEV_MODE=true
```

## 🚀 Routing System

INEX SPA uses a file-based routing system that is simple, powerful, and secure. It supports static routes, dynamic routes with parameters, and nested routes.

### Static Routes

To create a static route, create a file in the `web/` directory. For example, to create a `/about` route, create a file named `web/about.ahmed.php`.

### Nested Routes

To create nested routes, create subdirectories inside the `web/` directory. For example, to create a route `/admin/dashboard`, you would create the following file: `web/admin/dashboard.ahmed.php`.

The router will automatically resolve the URL to the correct file. This allows you to organize your application into logical modules.

**Example: Nested Static Route**
- **URL:** `/admin/settings`
- **File:** `web/admin/settings.ahmed.php`

### Dynamic Routes

To create a dynamic route that accepts parameters in the URL, you need to append `_dynamic` to your filename. For example, to create a route that handles `/users/some_user_id`, you would create a file named `web/users_dynamic.ahmed.php`.

The router will automatically capture the value after `/users/` and make it available in the `$_GET['data']` variable inside your page file.

**Example: Dynamic Route**
- **URL:** `/products/123`
- **File:** `web/products_dynamic.ahmed.php`
- **In `products_dynamic.ahmed.php`:** `$_GET['data']` will be `'123'`.

### Nested Dynamic Routes

You can also combine nested and dynamic routes. For example, to handle a URL like `/admin/users/edit/1`, you would create the file `web/admin/users/edit_dynamic.ahmed.php`.

**Example: Nested Dynamic Route**
- **URL:** `/admin/posts/view/45`
- **File:** `web/admin/posts/view_dynamic.ahmed.php`
- **In `view_dynamic.ahmed.php`:** `$_GET['data']` will be `'45'`.

### Security

The routing system is designed with security in mind. It prevents directory traversal attacks by ensuring that only files located within the `web/` directory can be accessed. Any attempt to access files outside of this directory will be blocked.

## 🧱 Component System

INEX SPA includes a simple yet powerful component system that allows you to create reusable UI elements. This helps in organizing your code and reducing duplication.

### Creating a Component

To create a component, simply create a new PHP file in the `components/` directory. The name of the file will be the name of the component.

For example, let's create a `Button` component in `components/Button.php`:

```php
<button class="btn">
    <?= $text ?>
</button>
```

As you can see, the component is a simple PHP file that can contain any HTML and PHP code. The data is passed to the component as an associative array, and the keys are extracted as variables.

### Using a Component

To use a component in your views, you can use the `component()` function:

```php
<?= component('Button', ['text' => 'Click Me!']) ?>
```

This will render the `Button` component and pass the `text` variable to it.

### Partial Hydration (Future Feature)

We are working on adding support for partial hydration, which will allow you to optionally use JavaScript to enhance your components on the client-side. Stay tuned for updates!
