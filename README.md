## Cronjob Management

This application includes a cronjob management system to schedule and run background tasks. Tasks are defined as PHP classes and can be managed using the `ammar` CLI.

### Cron Runner

The core script for executing cron tasks is `core/cron/cron_runner.php`. This script is designed to be called by your system's cron daemon (e.g., crontab).

**Usage:**

```bash
/usr/bin/php /path/to/your/project/core/cron/cron_runner.php <TaskName> >> /path/to/your/project/core/logs/cron.log 2>&1
```

- Replace `/usr/bin/php` with the actual path to your PHP interpreter if different.
- Replace `/path/to/your/project/` with the absolute path to your application's root directory.
- `<TaskName>` is the name of the cron task class you want to run (e.g., `ExampleTask`).
- It's recommended to redirect output to the `core/logs/cron.log` file for monitoring.

### `ammar` CLI Commands for Cronjobs

The `ammar` CLI tool provides several commands to help manage your cron tasks:

**1. `list:cron`**

   Lists all available cron tasks. These are the `.php` files found in the `core/cron/tasks/` directory.

   **Usage:**
   ```bash
   php ammar list:cron
   ```

**2. `make:cron <TaskName>`**

   Creates a new cron task file in `core/cron/tasks/`. The `<TaskName>` should be a valid PHP class name (e.g., `MyDailyReport`).

   **Usage:**
   ```bash
   php ammar make:cron MyDailyReport
   ```
   This will generate `core/cron/tasks/MyDailyReport.php` with a template class structure. You'll need to edit this file to implement the task's logic within the `handle()` method.

**3. `run:cron <TaskName>`**

   Manually triggers a specific cron task. This is useful for testing your cron tasks without waiting for the scheduled time.

   **Usage:**
   ```bash
   php ammar run:cron <TaskName>
   ```
   Example:
   ```bash
   php ammar run:cron ExampleTask
   ```

**4. `delete:cron <TaskName>`**

   Deletes a specific cron task file from `core/cron/tasks/`. You will be prompted for confirmation.

   **Usage:**
   ```bash
   php ammar delete:cron <TaskName>
   ```

**5. `clear:cron`**

   Deletes ALL cron task files from `core/cron/tasks/`. This is a destructive operation and will require double confirmation.

   **Usage:**
   ```bash
   php ammar clear:cron
   ```

### Creating a New Cron Task

1.  Use the `make:cron` command to generate the task file:
    ```bash
    php ammar make:cron YourNewTaskName
    ```
2.  Open the generated file `core/cron/tasks/YourNewTaskName.php`.
3.  Implement your task's logic within the `handle()` method of the class. You can use any PHP code, access your application's models, services, or other functions as needed. Ensure necessary classes and functions are loaded, potentially by referencing how `core/cron/cron_runner.php` or `index.php` load dependencies. The `cron_runner.php` should provide a basic environment, but complex tasks might need to ensure their specific dependencies are met.
4.  Test your task using `php ammar run:cron YourNewTaskName`.
5.  Once ready, schedule it via your system's crontab by pointing to `core/cron/cron_runner.php YourNewTaskName`.

## Built-in Motion Engine

**Note:** This feature is currently in Beta. While functional, it may undergo changes, and we appreciate any feedback!

This framework includes a lightweight, dependency-free JavaScript motion engine to apply CSS animations to HTML elements.

### Enabling the Engine

The Motion Engine is controlled via an environment variable in your `.env` file:

- `USE_ANIMATE`: Set to `true` to enable the engine (default) or `false` to disable it.
  When enabled, the necessary JavaScript (`public/JS/motion_engine.js`) and CSS (`public/css/motion-animations.css`) files are automatically included in your pages.

Example `.env` entry:
```
USE_ANIMATE=true
```

### Using the `animate` function

The core of the engine is the `animate()` JavaScript function.

**Syntax:**
`animate(elementOrSelector, animationName, durationMs)`

- `elementOrSelector`: Can be either an HTMLElement object or a CSS selector string (e.g., `'#myElement'`, `'.my-class'`).
- `animationName`: A string representing the name of the animation to apply (e.g., `'fade-in'`). This corresponds to a CSS class `motion-{animationName}` defined in `public/css/motion-animations.css`.
- `durationMs`: An integer specifying the animation duration in milliseconds (e.g., `300`).

**Example Usage:**

```html
<div id="myBox">Hello!</div>

<script>
  // Get the element
  const box = document.getElementById('myBox');

  // Animate it with 'fade-in' over 300ms
  animate(box, 'fade-in', 300);

  // Or using a selector
  // animate('#myBox', 'fade-in', 300);
</script>
```
The function handles adding and removing the necessary CSS classes and setting the animation duration.

### Adding New Animations

To add new animations:

1.  **Define Keyframes**: Open `public/css/motion-animations.css` and define your `@keyframes`. It's recommended to prefix them with `motion-` for clarity.
    ```css
    @keyframes motion-slide-up {
      from {
        transform: translateY(20px);
        opacity: 0;
      }
      to {
        transform: translateY(0);
        opacity: 1;
      }
    }
    ```

2.  **Create Animation Class**: Add a corresponding CSS class that applies these keyframes.
    ```css
    .motion-slide-up {
      animation-name: motion-slide-up;
    }
    ```
    The base class `.motion-animate` (which includes `animation-fill-mode: forwards;`) will be automatically applied by the `animate` function.

3.  **Use in JavaScript**: You can now use `'slide-up'` as the `animationName` in the `animate` function:
    ```javascript
    animate('#anotherElement', 'slide-up', 500);
    ```

## ✨ INEX DevTools

The INEX SPA framework includes a built-in debug bar for development environments, providing valuable insights into your application's performance and structure.

### Features

-   **Debug Bar:** A persistent bar at the bottom of the screen in development mode.
-   **Performance Stats:** View execution time and memory usage for each request.
-   **Database Queries:** Inspect all SQL queries executed for a page.

-   **Server Information:** Inspect `$_SERVER` variables.
-   **Session Data:** View the content of the `$_SESSION` superglobal.
-   **Request Data:** See `$_GET`, `$_POST`, and `$_COOKIE` data.

### Enabling and Using DevTools

The DevTools are controlled by an environment variable in your `.env` file:

-   `DEV_MODE`: Set to `true` to enable the debug bar. Set to `false` or remove the line for production environments.

Example `.env` entry:

```
DEV_MODE=true
```

Once enabled, the DevTools bar will appear at the bottom of your screen. You can use the following keyboard shortcut to toggle its visibility:

-   **`Ctrl + D`**: Show or hide the DevTools bar.

You can click on the tabs to navigate between different panels.

## 🌐 Built-in Fetch Layer

The INEX SPA framework includes a powerful and convenient fetch layer for making HTTP requests to external APIs. It's built on top of cURL and provides a simple interface with advanced features like auto-retry, caching, and automatic authorization headers.

### Enabling the Fetch Layer

To enable the fetch layer, set the `USE_FETCH` variable to `true` in your `.env` file:

```
USE_FETCH=true
```

### Using the `useFetch` function

Once enabled, you can use the `useFetch` function anywhere in your application.

**Syntax:**
`useFetch(string $url, array $options = []): array`

- `$url`: The URL of the API endpoint you want to call.
- `$options` (optional): An associative array of options to customize the request.

The function returns an associative array containing the `body`, `status`, and `error` of the response.

### Options

The `$options` array can contain the following keys:

- `method` (string): The HTTP method to use (e.g., `'GET'`, `'POST'`, `'PUT'`, `'DELETE'`). Defaults to `'GET'`.
- `headers` (array): An associative array of HTTP headers to send with the request.
- `body` (mixed): The body of the request. If an array is provided, it will be automatically encoded as JSON and the `Content-Type` header will be set to `application/json`.
- `retries` (int): The number of times to retry the request if it fails with a network error or a 5xx HTTP status code. Defaults to `0`.
- `retryDelay` (int): The delay in milliseconds between retries. Defaults to `1000`.
- `cache` (int): The number of seconds to cache the response. Defaults to `0` (no caching).
- `auth` (bool): Whether to automatically add the `Authorization` header. Defaults to `true`.

### Examples

**Basic GET request:**

```php
$response = useFetch('https://api.example.com/posts');

if ($response['status'] === 200) {
    $posts = json_decode($response['body'], true);
    // Do something with the posts
}
```

**POST request with a JSON body:**

```php
$postData = ['title' => 'New Post', 'body' => 'This is the content of the post.'];

$response = useFetch('https://api.example.com/posts', [
    'method' => 'POST',
    'body' => $postData,
]);

if ($response['status'] === 201) {
    // Post created successfully
}
```

**Request with auto-retry:**

```php
// This request will be retried 3 times with a 2-second delay between each retry if it fails.
$response = useFetch('https://api.example.com/flaky-endpoint', [
    'retries' => 3,
    'retryDelay' => 2000,
]);
```

**Request with caching:**

```php
// The response from this request will be cached for 1 hour (3600 seconds).
$response = useFetch('https://api.example.com/users', [
    'cache' => 3600,
]);
```

### Automatic Authorization Header

The fetch layer can automatically add an `Authorization` header to your requests. To use this feature, set the `AUTH_TOKEN` variable in your `.env` file:

```
AUTH_TOKEN=your-api-token
```

Now, all requests made with `useFetch` will include the `Authorization: Bearer your-api-token` header by default. You can disable this behavior for a specific request by setting the `auth` option to `false`:

```php
$response = useFetch('https://api.example.com/public-endpoint', [
    'auth' => false,
]);
```

## 🎛️ FormKit System

The INEX SPA framework includes a powerful FormKit system to handle form validation, sanitization, and data binding seamlessly.

### Enabling FormKit

To enable the FormKit system, set the `USE_FORMKIT` variable to `true` in your `.env` file:

```
USE_FORMKIT=true
```

### Using the `useFormKit` function

Once enabled, you can use the `useFormKit` function to create a new `FormKit` instance.

**Syntax:**
`useFormKit(array $config): FormKit`

- `$config`: An associative array defining the form fields and their validation rules.

### Example

```php
$formConfig = [
    'username' => [
        'required' => true,
        'validate' => [
            'minLength' => 3,
            'maxLength' => 20,
        ],
        'sanitize' => 'string',
        'messages' => [
            'required' => 'Username is required.',
            'minLength' => 'Username must be at least 3 characters.',
            'maxLength' => 'Username cannot exceed 20 characters.',
        ],
    ],
    'email' => [
        'required' => true,
        'validate' => [
            'email' => true,
        ],
        'sanitize' => 'email',
        'messages' => [
            'required' => 'Email is required.',
            'email' => 'Please enter a valid email address.',
        ],
    ],
];

$form = useFormKit($formConfig);

if ($_SERVER['REQUEST_METHOD'] === 'POST') {
    if ($form->validate($_POST)) {
        $sanitizedData = $form->getSanitizedData();
        // Process the sanitized data
    } else {
        $errors = $form->getErrors();
        // Display errors to the user
    }
}
```

### Async Validation

FormKit also supports asynchronous validation, which is useful for tasks like checking if a username is already taken. To use async validation, add an `async` rule to your field configuration. The value of the `async` rule should be a function that takes the field's value as an argument and returns `true` if the value is valid, and `false` otherwise.

```php
$formConfig = [
    'username' => [
        'async' => function ($value) {
            // In a real application, you would query your database here
            return $value !== 'existinguser';
        },
        'messages' => [
            'async' => 'Username is already taken.',
        ],
    ],
];

$form = useFormKit($formConfig);

if ($_SERVER['REQUEST_METHOD'] === 'POST') {
    $form->validate($_POST, function ($isValid) {
        if ($isValid) {
            // Form is valid
        } else {
            // Form is invalid
        }
    });
}
```

-   **Summary:** Removes the UTF-8 Byte Order Mark (BOM) from the beginning of a string, which can cause issues with file headers.
-   **Input:**
    -   `$string` (string): The string, often from file contents.
-   **Output:** (string) The string without the BOM.
-   **Example:**
    ```php
    $configFile = file_get_contents('config.json');
    $cleanedConfig = SecurityV2::removeBom($configFile);
    $config = json_decode($cleanedConfig, true);
    ```

## 🧱 Component System

INEX SPA includes a simple yet powerful component system that allows you to create reusable UI elements. This helps in organizing your code and reducing duplication.

### Creating a Component

To create a component, simply create a new PHP file in the `components/` directory. The name of the file will be the name of the component.

For example, let's create a `Button` component in `components/Button.php`:

```php
<button class="btn">
    <?= $text ?>
</button>
```

As you can see, the component is a simple PHP file that can contain any HTML and PHP code. The data is passed to the component as an associative array, and the keys are extracted as variables.

### Using a Component

To use a component in your views, you can use the `component()` function:

```php
<?= component('Button', ['text' => 'Click Me!']) ?>
```

This will render the `Button` component and pass the `text` variable to it.

### Partial Hydration (Future Feature)

We are working on adding support for partial hydration, which will allow you to optionally use JavaScript to enhance your components on the client-side. Stay tuned for updates!

## 📧 Mail Service

INEX SPA includes a built-in mail service that allows you to send emails from your application. The mail service is a wrapper around the popular PHPMailer library, providing a simple and consistent API for sending emails.

### Configuration

To use the mail service, you first need to configure it in your `.env` file. The following mail-related variables are available:

- `MAIL_MAILER`: The mailer to use (e.g., `smtp`, `sendmail`).
- `MAIL_HOST`: The SMTP host (e.g., `smtp.mailtrap.io`).
- `MAIL_PORT`: The SMTP port (e.g., `587`).
- `MAIL_USERNAME`: The SMTP username.
- `MAIL_PASSWORD`: The SMTP password.
- `MAIL_ENCRYPTION`: The SMTP encryption (e.g., `tls`).
- `MAIL_FROM_ADDRESS`: The "from" email address.
- `MAIL_FROM_NAME`: The "from" name.

### Sending Emails

To send an email, you can use the `Mail` class. Here's an example of how to send a simple email:

```php
//
// Note: This is a simplified example. You should handle errors and exceptions in a real application.
//
require_once 'core/import/PHPMailer/init.php';
require_once 'core/functions/PHP/getEnvValue.php';
require_once 'core/functions/Mail.php';

$mail = new Mail();

$mail->addRecipient('test@example.com', 'Test User');
$mail->setSubject('Test Email');
$mail->setBody('This is a test email.');
$mail->isHTML(false);

if ($mail->send()) {
    echo 'Email sent successfully.';
} else {
    echo 'Failed to send email: ' . $mail->errorInfo;
}

```

## 🧪 Testing Tools

INEX SPA now includes a set of testing tools powered by PHPUnit to help you write robust and reliable applications. You can run unit, component, and snapshot tests using the `ammar` CLI.

### Running Tests

You can run tests using the following commands:

-   `php ammar test`: Run all tests (unit, component, and snapshot).
-   `php ammar test:unit`: Run only the unit tests.
-   `php ammar test:component`: Run only the component tests.
-   `php ammar test:snapshot`: Run only the snapshot tests.

### Writing Tests

Tests are located in the `tests/` directory, with subdirectories for `Unit`, `Component`, and `Snapshot` tests.

#### Unit Tests

Unit tests are used to test individual units of code, such as a single function or method. Here's an example of a unit test in `tests/Unit/ExampleUnitTest.php`:

```php
<?php

use PHPUnit\Framework\TestCase;

class ExampleUnitTest extends TestCase
{
    public function test_true_is_true()
    {
        $this->assertTrue(true);
    }
}
```

#### Component Tests

Component tests are used to test individual components of your application, such as a view component. Here's an example of a component test in `tests/Component/ExampleComponentTest.php`:

```php
<?php

use PHPUnit\Framework\TestCase;

class ExampleComponentTest extends TestCase
{
    public function test_component_loads()
    {
        // This is a placeholder for a real component test.
        // In a real-world scenario, you would render a component
        // and assert that it contains the expected HTML.
        $this->assertTrue(true);
    }
}
```

#### Snapshot Tests

Snapshot tests are used to test that the output of a function or component has not changed unexpectedly. Here's an example of a snapshot test in `tests/Snapshot/ExampleSnapshotTest.php`:

```php
<?php

use PHPUnit\Framework\TestCase;

class ExampleSnapshotTest extends TestCase
{
    public function test_snapshot_matches()
    {
        // This is a placeholder for a real snapshot test.
        // In a real-world scenario, you would use a snapshot
        // testing library to compare the output of a function
        // or component to a stored snapshot.
        $this->assertTrue(true);
    }
}
```
