# Error Pages Directory

The `public/errors` directory and its `style.css` file are essential framework components:

* Required for proper error handling and display
* Contains styled templates for HTTP error codes
* Ensures consistent error presentation
* Do not modify or delete these files
* Framework functionality depends on their presence
